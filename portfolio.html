1. I picked this portfolio because I liked how it was interactive. I liked that the viewer plays a game to see the works of the designer.
<br>
<br>
2. I liked this portfolio because it was different from other portfolios in the shape of the objects. Most portfolios have a geometric shaped background to the photo, but for this portfolio, an organic shaped background was used which was nice to see.

<br>
3. I liked that this portfolio has images that are 3D, it makes it seem as if the viewer can touch the object, as if it is right in front of them.
