	1. Good design is innovative.
<br>a. My interpretation is that design can evolve and change for 		<br>
	<br>a.the better. What works today may not work as well in the future and design should be able to adapt and change.
	<br>
	<br>b. Light bulb
	<br>
	<br>c. In the future I would make sure my products have room to grow, I would constantly be experimenting with new ideas.
	<br>
<br>2. Good design makes a product useful.
	<br>
	<br>a.Good design means the product works. No matter how it looks or the features it has, if the product doesn’t work then it useless.
	<br>
	<br>b. Slinky 
	<br>
	<br>c. As I continue with design I will work to not forget that apart from designing something I have to make sure it is useful. the product is of no use if it doesn't work how it is suppose to.
	<br>
<br>3. Good design is aesthetic.
	<br>
	<br>a. The product needs to be appealing to the user, it need to fit in the users lifestyle and work correctly.
	<br>
	<br>b. Instant pot
	<br>
	<br>c. I have never really thought about this concept before. In the future I will try and take this into account when creating new things.
	<br>
<br>4. Good design makes a product understandable.
	<br>
	<br>a. No caption or description is needed for good design. It can stand on its own. The product is able to speak for itself and express its function
	<br>
	<br>b. Silicone baking mat
	<br>
	<br>c. In the future I will try to create designs that can be understood without having to be described. If the description of the product is lost it should still be useful, and understood.  
	<br>
<br>5. Good design is unobtrusive.
	<br>
	<br>a. The product isn’t over the top filled with fancy details or unnecessary decorations. The user is able to take the product and use it in any way they wish to without being overwhelmed by the product.
	<br>
	<br>b. Denman brush
	<br>
	<br>c. I will have to work on this and make sure I dont cross the line and the product details are too much and retract from the product.
	<br>
<br>6. Good design is honest.
	<br>
	<br>a. Good design means telling the truth about the product and its uses. It doesn’t claim to work in 7 different ways when in reality it only works in 2 different ways.
	<br>
	<br>b. Goo gone
	<br>
	<br>c. In my work I will continue to be truthful to my product and making sure it works as it should.
	<br>
<br>7. Good design is long-lasting.
	<br>
	<br>a. Fads come and go all the design but good design withstands the test of time. It is a product that can live in society today and still remain relevant and useful 50 years from now.
	<br>
	<br>b. Cast iron skillet
	<br>
	<br>c. I will work hard to make sure the products I design can remain relevant today and 50 years from now.
	<br>
<br>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail.
	<br>
	<br>a. Practice makes perfect. Without trial and error the best product can’t be created. The product has to be tested time and again in order to guarantee the accuracy of the product.
	<br>
	<br>b.Clothing
	<br>
	<br>c. In the past I have always strived to check my work multiple times before I turn it in. Moving forward I will continue to check my designs to 
	<br>
<br>9. Good design is environmentally-friendly.
	<br>
	<br>a.
	Design doesn’t pollute the environment unnecessarily. It takes care to keep its environmental footprint to a minimum.
	<br>
	<br>b. Reusable shopping bag
	<br>
	<br>c. This is a concept I never really thought about, but living in the time we are living in today it is important to do what we can to prevent the environment from being polluted. 
	<br>
<br>10. Good design is as little design as possible.
	<br>
	<br>a. Just like the saying less is more, this correlates with good design. It doesn’t need to be over the top to be useful or appreciated.
	<br>
	<br>b. Velcro 
	<br>
	<br>c. I will have to work on making sure I don't add anything extra to my design that retracts from it. There are times when i add things that don't really add to the overall design of the product/project.
