</div>
	
<div class="gray1">Good design is innovative. </div>
<div class="gray2">a. My interpretation is that design can evolve and change for the better. What works today may not work as well in the future and design should be able to adapt and change. 
</div>
<div class="gray3">b. Light Bulb. </div>
<div class="gray4"> c. In the future I would make sure my products have room to grow, I would constantly be experimenting with new ideas.</div>
	
	
<div class="coral1">2. </div>
<div class="gray5"> Good design makes a product useful
</div>
<div class="gray6">a. Good design means the product works. No matter how it looks or the features it has, if the product doesn’t work then it useless. </div>
<div class="gray7">b. Slinky. </div>
<div class="gray8">c. As I continue with design I will work to not forget that apart from designing something I have to make sure it is useful. the product is of no use if it doesn't work how it is suppose to. </div>
	
	
<div class="coral2">3. </div>
<div class="gray9">Good design is aesthetic </div>
<div class="gray10">a. The product needs to be appealing to the user, it needs to fit in the users lifestyle and work correctly. </div>
<div class="gray11">b. Instant Pot. </div>
<div class="gray12">c. I have never really thought about this concept before. In the future I will try and take this into account when creating new things. </div>
	
	
<div class="coral3">4. </div>
<div class="gray13">Good design makes a product understandable. </div>
<div class="gray14">a. No caption or description is needed for good design. It can stand on its own. The product is able to speak for itself and express its function. </div>
<div class="gray15">b. Silicone baking mat. </div>
<div class="gray16">c. In the future I will try to create designs that can be understood without having to be described. If the description of the product is lost it should still be useful, and understood. </div>
	
<div class="number5">5.</div>
	
	
<div class="coral4"> </div>
<div class="gray17"> Good design is unobtrusive.</div>
<div class="gray18">a. The product isn’t over the top filled with fancy details or unnecessary decorations. The user is able to take the product and use it in any way they wish to without being overwhelmed by the product. </div>
<div class="gray19">b. Denman brush. </div>
<div class="gray20">c. I will have to work on this and make sure I dont cross the line and the product details are too much and retract from the product. </div>
	
	
<div class="number6">6.</div>
	
	
<div class="coral5"> </div>
<div class="gray21">Good design is honest. </div>
<div class="gray22">a. Good design means telling the truth about the product and its uses. It doesn’t claim to work in 7 different ways when in reality it only works in 2 different ways. </div>
<div class="gray23">b. Goo gone. </div>
<div class="gray24">c. In my work I will continue to be truthful to my product and making sure it works as it should. </div>
	
	
<div class="coral6">7. </div>
<div class="gray25">Good design is long-lasting.</div>
<div class="gray26">a. Fads come and go all the design but good design withstands the test of time. It is a product that can live in society today and still remain relevant and useful 50 years from now. </div>
<div class="gray27">b. Cast iron skillet. </div>
<div class="gray28">c. I will work hard to make sure the products I design can remain relevant today and 50 years from now. </div>
	
	
<div class="coral7">8. </div>
<div class="gray29">Good design is thorough down to the last detail. </div>
<div class="gray30">a. Practice makes perfect. Without trial and error the best product can’t be created. The product has to be tested time and again in order to guarantee the accuracy of the product.</div>
<div class="gray31">b. Clothing. </div>
<div class="gray32">c. In the past I have always strived to check my work multiple times before I turn it in. Moving forward I will continue to check my designs before the end product.  </div>
	
	
<div class="coral8">9. </div>
<div class="gray33">Good design is environmentally-friendly. </div>

<div class="gray36">c. This is a concept I never really thought about, but living in the time we are living in today it is important to do what we can to prevent the environment from being polluted. </div>
	
	
<div class="coral9">10. </div>
<div class="gray37">Good design is as little design as possible. </div>
<div class="gray38">a. Just like the saying less is more, this correlates with good design. It doesn’t need to be over the top to be useful or appreciated. </div>
<div class="gray39">b. Velcro. </div>
<div class="gray40">c. I will have to work on making sure I don't add anything extra to my design that retracts from it. There are times when I add things that don't really add to the overall design of the product/project. </div>
